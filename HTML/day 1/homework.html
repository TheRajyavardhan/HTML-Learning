            <b><i>When two or more elements chemically combine in a fixed ratio by mass, the
                 obtained product is known as a compound.</i></b>Compounds can be defined as
                substances consisting of 2 or more different types of elements in a fixed ratio of their atoms. When the elements combine, some individual property of the elements is lost and the newly formed compound has new properties.
